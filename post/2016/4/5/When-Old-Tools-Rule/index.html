<h1>When Old Tools Rule</h1>

<p>Today there was a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11430442">discussion on Hacker News</a>
about using Vim as a commandline tool within Unix pipes. Of course this immediately
appealed to me, because I’ve invested a lot of time becoming proficient in it and some
days I just don’t want to try to remember if and how sed and Vim’s s command differ.
But while I was initially looking for a bunch of new Vim tricks to add to my repertoire,
instead the conversation diverged how Vim was derived from ed, how in many ways old
tools like terminal text editors still have much to offer, and how this shouldn’t surprise
us.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_warning_ramble">WARNING: Ramble</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is some research out there suggesting that by way of our social constructs of
teaching and learning, for increasingly more of our lives, humans have become smarter.
But have we really? Is Microsoft Word strictly better than Vim, because it was made later
and thus probably by smarter individuals? Certainly no programmer would think so. Word
is fine for its own set of constraints, but as such it will probably not be right for
dealing with code or textual data very often.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Still, the idea that humans have gotten smarter has a certain appeal. Intuitively it
makes sense. We went from algebra to calculus to quantum mechanics, didn’t we? And for
years the brightest physicists and mathematicians debated quantum principles we now accept
as fact. But the argument that since we can easily understand now what used to seem so
difficult, so we must be smarter, is based on a false premise. While we like to imagine
that Isaac Newton discovered calculus in a flash of inspiration, just as he supposedly
(totally did not) &quot;discover&quot; gravity from an apple-related incident, instead he
mundanely (or excitingly if you’re a mathematician) solved a problem by combining
common knowledge from the field with a small leap of intuition and insight. Einstein and
every other genius did the same thing, although some were able to make slightly larger
small leaps and some have been portrayed in the media as having made larger leaps (for
the last time, Mark, Stephen Hawking is very smart, but he is not the premier physicist
of this era!).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This brings us back to the HN discussion. So what is it that makes us feel so superior
to ancient civilizations, although we still perform their plays, quote their philosophy,
and look for advanced alien technology in their tombs? It’s tools. And this shouldn’t be
surprising to any of us. After all, what makes us humans the masters of the animal
kingdom? We not only use tools, but improve them and pass them on to future generations
through teaching. So while we may feel smarter, let’s not forget that we are just
standing on the backs of our ancestors - our ancestors who were just as smart as us.
<em>Principia Mathematica</em> could not have been written by the ancient Greeks nor without
them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I want to take a moment just to remind myself not to dismiss an idea, tool, or
technique merely due to its age. So few ideas are truly subsumed by later ones, because
there is a dimishing return to improving tools. Generally, new tools solve a new problem.
Now, there is one big exception to this rule: revolutions. Revolutions, by their very
definition, turn things on their heads. Then tools like the spreadsheet or slide rule
are vastly improved by using the new technology (computers). So putting this all together,
we know that people didn’t used to be stupid and unless there was a revolution recently,
no one may have even tried to improve their tools, just based a tool for solving a new
problem off of it. Therefore we can logically dispute the assumptions of all arguments
like editors vs IDEs, commandline vs GUI, and ed vs vi. Neither newer nor older have
an advantage and no two people can ever be solving the exact same problem the same way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you thought that this post had neither a single argument nor single conclusion, you
would be correct. But now I have proof that my blog generator pipeline is at least
working basically.</p>
